ansible inventory is a group of hosts entered in /etc/ansible/hosts
otherthan this inventory also will works with anisble by pass -i (path to inventory file) in command line
formats of ansible inventory
default inventory includes /etc/ansible/hosts
ravi.cilent.com --------as plan client

[webservers]
webserver1.com
webserver2.com

[prod servers]
prod1.com
prod2.com

this is the default format

The inventory file in YAML configuraation
all:
  hosts:
    childern:
	  webservers:
	    hosts:
		  webserver1.com
		  webserver2.com
		  
	  dbservers:
	    hosts:
		  dbserver1.com
		  dbserver2.com
		  
		  
if the host is not working default ssh port number 22
we can specify like this webserver1.com:5306 in the inventory file
if we have static ips want alias You can also describe hosts via variables:
jumper ansible_port=5555 ansible_host=192.0.2.50 in default inventory file

YAML format
hosts:
  jumper:
    ansible_port: 5555
    ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
	
In the above example, trying to ansible against the host alias “jumper” (which may not even be a real hostname) will contact 192.0.2.50 on port 5555. Note that this is using a feature of the inventory file to define some special variables. Generally speaking, this is not the best way to define variables that describe your system policy, but we’ll share suggestions on doing this later.
