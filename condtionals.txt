conditinals are very useful in conditional situations

for example inventory file contains
web    ansible_host=server1.example.com ansible_connection=ssh

then we can write play as follows

---
- name: executing a sample installation
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - 
      yum:
        name: wget
        state: present
        when: ansible_host == 'server1.example.com' # example of conditional statement
